# Setup

This page will guide you through the installation of the requirements for running the workshop exercises and it will explain how ROS 2, Gazebo and PX4 will interact.

The images contains all the required dependencies for the workshop, in particular:

- [GZ HARMONIC](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/getstarted/)
- [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)
- [PX4](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot) v1.16.0 simulator

To further simplify working in the container, VSCode [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are provided.

## Prerequisites

All the instructions and all the provided scripts have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04 and WSL2.
Docker development in macOS is not supported.

- **Docker**. The easiest way to start using and testing the ROS 2 packages made for this workshop is through the available AMD64 and ARM64 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.
For this reason, the rest of the document will assume that Docker is used.
- **QGroundControl**. [GQC](https://qgroundcontrol.com/) provides intuitive operator control of PX4 drones, it lets you configure PX4, calibrate the drone sensors and plan mission.
QGC is already installed in the Docker images.
However, it requires GUI to enabled for the container.
If this is not possible (currently for MAC) then QGC will have to be installed on the host system.
- **Foxglove**. [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/download) will make visualizing the drone state and perceived environment a more user friendly way.

Prerequisites installation instructions are available in [docs/prerequisites.md](./prerequisites.md).

Once Docker is installed you can verify the installation by pulling the latest workshop docker image:

```sh
docker pull dronecode/roscon-25-workshop:latest
```

## Container structure

- Most of the required ROS 2 packages are installed through the available binaries:
  - [GZ HARMONIC](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/getstarted/)
  - [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)
- Those packages that cannot be installed through binaries and that are dependencies for the main workshop exercise packages are source installed in `/home/ubuntu/px4_ros_ws/install`:

  - [Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent) version 2.4.2
  - [PX4 msgs](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) version 1.16
  - [PX4 ROS 2 Interface Library](https://github.com/Auterion/px4-ros2-interface-lib)
  - `ros_gz`

  Because one of the workshop exercises depends on OpenCV 4.10, `OpenCV`, `ros-humble-vision-opencv` and `ros-humble-image-common` are source installed too.

- [PX4 v1.16.0](https://px4.io/) simulator and its supported GZ Harmonic models and worlds.
- [GGroundControl](https://qgroundcontrol.com/) v5.0.8

### PX4 SITL

The docker image contains the binaries for running PX4 on linux, to interface it with Gazebo and all Gazebo models and worlds that support PX4.
The binaries are compiled in specific layer and to reduce the container size, only the final executables are copied in the final image.

- The binaries for PX4 are located in `/home/ubuntu/px4_sitl`
- The PX4 compatible GZ worlds and models are instead located in `/home/ubuntu/PX4-gazebo-models/`

Please refer to [docs/customize_px4.md](./customize_px4.md) to know how to use a custom version of PX4.

### QGroundControl

QGC v5.0.8 Linux Appimage is added and then extracted during the compilation of the docker AMD64 image.
If you're running on AMD64 with GUI, then you can open QGC directly from inside the container.

If instead you're running without GUI, then you will have to connect PX4 to a QGC instance running on the _host_.

## How to start the simulation

There are two ways to start and interact w through VSCode DevContainers or with pure Docker commands.

### Starting the container with pure Docker commands

This mode does not require VSCode.
On the other hand it is slightly less user friendly as you'll have to open multiple terminals inside the container.

You can use

```sh
./docker/docker_run.sh
```

The script will:

- Start the container giving it the name _px4-roscon-25_ and attach a shell to it.
- Forward port `8765` to simplify Foxglove client connection.
- Mount the repository in `/home/ubuntu/roscon-25-workshop_ws/src/roscon-25-workshop`
- Forward X11 to run GUI applications (GZ client, QGC) from inside the container.

You can use also use two options:

- `--no-gui` to disable GUI in the container.
This option also forwards port `18570` to allow external (Host) QGC connection.
- `--nvidia` to run the container with the `nvidia` runtime (it requires the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) installed on the host).

When using this method you can attach new shell to your container by running

```sh
docker exec -it px4-roscon-25 bash
```

From now-on, all commands are assumed to be run from a terminal inside the container unless otherwise specified.

### Starting the container through VSCode DevContainers

To use the DevContainers, simply open the workshop repo in VSCode, then type `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in container`.
Finally, select the devcontainer of your choice.
VSCode will automatically reopen inside the running container.

### Starting the PX4-GZ simulation

PX4 can directly connect to GZ using the `gz-transport` libraries.
This means that PX4 can control any GZ model as long as the model uses the required sensor and actuation plugins.

For this workshop we will use the x500 quadrotor model.

![X500](./assets/X500.png)

The PX4 Gazebo worlds and models are available in the `/home/ubuntu/PX4-gazebo-models` container directory.
From there you can start a GZ simulation with a PX4 compatible world:

```sh
python3 /home/ubuntu/PX4-gazebo-models/simulation-gazebo --model_store /home/ubuntu/PX4-gazebo-models/ --world default
```

- If you want to run the gz server in headless mode, add the option `--headless`.
- If you want to change the world, then change the argument of `--world`.

Note that `--headless` is mandatory when running without GUI.

The expected output when GUI is enabled is

```sh
ubuntu@fe14532c7704:~$ python3 /home/ubuntu/PX4-gazebo-models/simulation-gazebo --model_store /home/ubuntu/PX4-gazebo-models/
Found: 219 files in /home/ubuntu/PX4-gazebo-models/
Models directory not empty. Overwrite not set. Not downloading models.

[Err] [SystemLoader.cc:92] Failed to load system plugin [libGstCameraSystem.so] : Could not find shared library.
```

- Please ignore the error messages about the plugins not found.
- The gazebo client window will open on the empty world.
- No PX4 model will appear.
This is normal as PX4 instance and model will be spawned in a different step.

![empty GZ world](./assets/empty_gz_world.png)

Once the GZ server is running, you can spawn the `x500` model and attach a PX4 instance to it with

```sh
PX4_GZ_STANDALONE=1 PX4_SYS_AUTOSTART=4001 PX4_PARAM_UXRCE_DDS_SYNCT=0 /home/ubuntu/px4_sitl/bin/px4 -w /home/ubuntu/px4_sitl/romfs
```

The expected output is

```sh
$ PX4_GZ_STANDALONE=1 PX4_SYS_AUTOSTART=4001 PX4_PARAM_UXRCE_DDS_SYNCT=0 /home/ubuntu/px4_sitl/bin/px4 -w /home/ubuntu/px4_sitl/romfs

```

Let's analyze this command:

- `PX4_GZ_STANDALONE=1` tells the PX4 startup script that it will need to connect to an already running GZ server.
- `PX4_SYS_AUTOSTART=4001` tells the PX4 startup script that it has to use the `4001` _airframe_.
This airframe is defined in the [PX4 simulated airframes](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/tree/v1.16.0/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes) folder and is bound to the `x500` model.
Because not explicit model name was given, PX4 will insert the model in the GZ world.
An explicit mentioning of the model name would have made PX4 to simply connect to an already spawned model.
- `PX4_PARAM_UXRCE_DDS_SYNCT=0` disabled the [time synchronization](https://docs.px4.io/v1.16/en/ros2/user_guide#ros-gazebo-and-px4-time-synchronization) feature between ROS 2 and PX4.
Synchronization is not needed as Gazebo will control the clock for both PX4 and ROS 2.

The complete documentation for running PX4 simulation in Gazebo is part of [PX4 documentation](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/sim_gazebo_gz/).

![GZ world with x500 spawned](./assets/gz_world_with_x500.png)

Before taking off you just need to connect QGC to your simulated drone.
If you started you container with the GUI, then you can simply run

```sh
/home/ubuntu/QGroundControl/qgroundcontrol
```

If instead you don't have GUI in your container, then you can still run QGC on the host and attach it to the simulated PX4 instance.

To do so, first [install QGC](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/Stable_V5.0/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/download_and_install.html), then start it and create a custom UDP connection link by setting the server ip to `127.0.0.1` and the port to `18570`.

![QGC lin](./assets/qgc_custom_udp_connection.png)

The no-gui container automatically exposed the udp port `18570` to the host.
The GUI-enable container does not expose the port so this method won't for it.

On the PX4 terminal you will see the message

```sh
INFO  [mavlink] partner IP: 172.17.0.1
INFO  [commander] Ready for takeoff!
```

This is all you need to do to start the GZ + PX4 simulation, you can now takeoff!

## Next step (optional) - Link the simulation to ROS 2

With the simulation up an running, it is time to bridge ROS 2 with Gazebo and PX4.

The following sections will demo the essential steps in this process.
However, when trying the exercises you can leverage the [common launchfile](../px4_roscon_25/px4_roscon_25/README.md) which automatically sets up the required bridges.

1. **Clock bridging.**  We want to leverage the GZ clock and use it to time all our ROS 2 node.
This is accomplished by first creating an unidirectional bridge between the gz `/clock` topic and the ROS 2 one and then by commanding all ROS 2 to use the newly created `/clock` ROS 2 topic as time reference.
We will use the `ros_gz_bridge` package to create the bridge:

    ```sh
    ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /clock@rosgraph_msgs/msg/Clock[gz.msgs.Clock
    ```

    While the ROS 2 behavior will be set by the parameter `use_sim_time`.
2. **ROS 2 - PX4 bridge.** PX4 leverages [eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS](https://micro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.4.3/) which internal [PX4 messages](https://docs.px4.io/v1.16/en/middleware/uorb) to be directly exposed to the ROS 2 network.
The simulated PX4 instance automatically start the Micro XRCE-DDS client using UDP protocol on port 8888, what we need to do is to just start the agent with the same settings.

    ```sh
    MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
    ```

    after running this command you can see PX4 establish the connection - the expected output is a sequence of messages like

    ```sh
    INFO  [uxrce_dds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/vehicle_status_v1 data writer, topic id: 279
    INFO  [uxrce_dds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/airspeed_validated data writer, topic id: 14
    INFO  [uxrce_dds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/vtol_vehicle_status data writer, topic id: 288
    INFO  [uxrce_dds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/home_position data writer, topic id: 123
    ```

### Inspecting PX4 messages

Now that the [PX4 messages](https://docs.px4.io/v1.16/en/msg_docs/) are available to ROS 2, you can list them with

```sh
ros2 topic list
```

The messages in the topics with namespace `/fmu/in` are sent from ROS 2 to PX4 while the ones with namespace `/fmu/out` go from PX4 to ROS 2.

For example, you can check the PX4 vehicle status with

```sh
ros2 topic echo /fmu/out/vehicle_status_v1
```

You can also try the `sensor_combined_listener` node from the [px4_ros_com](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com) package and get a user friendly visualization of PX4 accelerometer and gyroscope data:

```sh
ros2 run px4_ros_com sensor_combined_listener --ros-args -p use_sim_time:=true
```

It will output something like:

```sh
RECEIVED SENSOR COMBINED DATA
=============================
ts: 93380000
gyro_rad[0]: -0.000287732
gyro_rad[1]: -0.000181083
gyro_rad[2]: -0.00105683
gyro_integral_dt: 4000
accelerometer_timestamp_relative: 0
accelerometer_m_s2[0]: -0.00764366
accelerometer_m_s2[1]: 6.15756e-05
accelerometer_m_s2[2]: -9.79929
accelerometer_integral_dt: 4000
```

### Foxglove visualization

You can use the [px4_tf](../px4_roscon_25/px4_tf/README.md) packages, in conjunction with `foxglove_bridge` to visualize in 3D the drone `base_link`.

The `px4_tf_publisher` node subscribes to PX4 `/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry` topic and publishes a derived transform for the `odom` frame to the `base_link` frame.

```sh
ros2 run px4_tf px4_tf_publisher --ros-args -p use_sim_time:=true
```

Finally `foxglove_bridge` let's us visualize the tf in Foxglove.

```sh
ros2 run foxglove_bridge foxglove_bridge --ros-args -p use_sim_time:=true
```

Launch your Foxglove client and open a connection of type _Foxglove WebSocket_ with url `ws://localhost:8765`.

![foxglove example](./assets/foxglove.png)

**Note:** when restarting the simulations and the foxglove_bridge, you might have to restart Foxglove client too to re-establish the connection.

### Recompiling the ROS 2 workspace

To recompile the ROS 2 workspace:

```sh
cd ~/roscon-25-workshop_ws/
source ~/px4_ros_ws/install/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers 2 --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
```

> **Note:** Limiting `--parallel-workers 2` and `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2` prevents high CPU core machines from overloading RAM (OOM freeze/crash) during C++ compilation.

## Troubleshooting

### T1: Gazebo GUI not showing

A1: Make sure you're running the container with GPU support.

### T2: Machine freezes or crashes during `colcon build` (Out of Memory)

A2: Heavy C++ compilation across many CPU threads exhausts available system RAM. Always restrict parallel workers:
```sh
colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers 2 --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2 -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
```
Or build only the specific package you are working on with `--packages-select <pkg_name>`.

### T3: on WSL2 I'm getting `docker: Error response from daemon: error gathering device information while adding custom device "/dev/dri": no such file or directory`

A2: Only `./docker/docker_run.sh --nvidia` combined with NVIDIA Container Toolkit works out of the box on WSL2.
If you don't have nvidia drivers or NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed on WSL2 you can run it headless `./docker/docker_run.sh --no-gui` or you can try removing `DOCKER_CMD="$DOCKER_CMD --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri"` from `./docker/docker_run.sh`.
